So reasonably priced, staff very friendly and our wait to board was less than 30 minutes on Easter Sunday at 9:30 pm. Loved that it went around 3 times!  You can put your camera down for the last round and just take in the spectacular views!  It’s a very smooth, gentle ride. Suggest going at night if you’re as enamoured with the harbour lights as I am! The cart’s glass was dripping wet with condensation so it was difficult to get the best photos but there’s some sections that offered a clear view. Each cart holds 8 people; you can pay extra to have your own cart. Excellent attraction!",

The line to get on is very long (about 45 minutes) and that is without waiting in another very long line just to buy the tickets.

Try to avoid sitting on the side further away from the sea, especially on the left as you enter because that has by far the worst view.

              "text": "Exploring Tradition: A Journey Through The Tin Hau Temple Complex\n\nNestled in the heart of Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon, the Tin Hau Temple Complex stands as a testament to Hong Kong’s rich cultural heritage. Comprising five distinct buildings steeped in history, this sacred site offers visitors a captivating glimpse into the city’s past.\n\nAs I wandered through the complex, I was struck by the serenity of the surroundings. The intricate architecture and ornate detailing of each building spoke volumes about the craftsmanship and devotion of generations past.\n\nThe journey begins with the Kwun Yum temple, a marvel of construction dating back to 1894. Its ancient walls seem to whisper tales of centuries gone by, inviting visitors to step back in time and immerse themselves in the spiritual energy that permeates the air.\n\nNext, the Shing Wong Temple captivated my senses with its aura of reverence. Built in 1878, this sacred space exudes a sense of ancient wisdom, serving as a sanctuary for worshippers seeking solace and guidance.\n\nAt the heart of the complex lies the Tin Hau Temple, the oldest of its kind. Steeped in legend and tradition, this revered shrine pays homage to the goddess of the sea, offering a place of solace for fishermen and seafarers throughout the ages.\n\nAs I continued my exploration, I discovered the Kwun Yam Lau She Tan and Hsu Yuen, each with its own unique story to tell. From the communal hall steeped in history to the disused study hall echoing with the whispers of scholars past, every corner of the complex holds a treasure trove of memories waiting to be uncovered.\n\nAs I stood before the Nine-Dragon Wall in the Public Square Street Children’s Playground and Rest Garden, I couldn’t help but marvel at the resilience of Hong Kong’s cultural heritage. Despite the passage of time and the winds of change, the Tin Hau Temple Complex remains a steadfast symbol of tradition and spirituality.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Tin Hau Temple Complex was nothing short of enchanting. It’s a place where the past meets the present, and where the spirit of Hong Kong’s ancestors lives on in every stone and every prayer. Whether you’re a history buff, a spiritual seeker, or simply a curious traveler, this sacred site is a must-visit destination that will leave you in awe of the enduring power of tradition.",

From the moment we stepped foot inside, the park greeted us with a plethora of attractions and experiences that catered to all interests. Although our children were unable to participate in many of the thrilling rides due to height restrictions, Ocean Park proved to be a captivating destination.\n\nOne of the most outstanding features of our visit was the spectacular aquarium. Nestled within the park, the centerpiece of the aquarium was an enormous cylindrical fish tank that left us in awe. This magnificent tank boasted an abundance of a singular type of fish, creating a mesmerizing display of life and color. The tank was so full that it seemed as if the fish were constantly in motion, creating a truly captivating sight.\n\nIn addition to the breathtaking fish tank, the aquarium also presented an engaging fish feeding show. This interactive experience allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the marine world and witness firsthand how the fish interacted with their environment. The show was both educational and entertaining, leaving us with a newfound appreciation for the wonders of underwater life.\n\nWhile the dining options within the park were satisfactory, we found the food to be ordinary without any standout dishes. Therefore, we suggest exploring outside options or, for a surprisingly delightful meal, visiting the nearby McDonald's, which offered the tastiest fare during our visit.\n\nThe true highlight of our experience, however, was the Vision of Hong Kong. This awe-inspiring show, which commenced at 19:15, showcased a combination of projection mapping, fountains, fire, laser effects, and music. The result was a breathtaking visual extravaganza that brought Hong Kong's vibrant spirit to life. The show immersed us in a world of radiant colors, synchronized movements, and captivating music, leaving an indelible mark in our memories. It was an absolute marvel, exemplifying the charm and allure of Hong Kong.\n\nDespite the slight letdown regarding the height requirements for rides and the average dining options, our visit to Ocean Park Hong Kong was an unforgettable experience. The highlight, without a doubt, was the remarkable cylindrical fish tank, bustling with a plethora of one type of fish. It was truly a sight to behold and left us captivated. Moreover, the engaging fish feeding show provided us with an educational and interactive glimpse into the fascinating marine world.\n\nWe would like to express our thanks to Ocean Park Hong Kong for providing us with such an enjoyable and enlightening day. We eagerly anticipate the opportunity to return in the future, eager to explore even more mesmerizing wonders within your gates.",

It is the second largest theme park in Hong Kong, after Hong Kong Disneyland, as well as the largest theme park in Hong Kong by area. It is also the second oldest theme park in Hong Kong, after the now-defunct Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park which closed on 31 March 1997, four months before the 1997 handover.\n\nOpened on 10 January 1977, Ocean Park became popular, but 28 years later, it was unprofitable and widely expected to close due to the new Hong Kong Disneyland. However, the Park responded with a HK$5.5 billion development plan that saw it expand to over 80 attractions and rides, and steadily grow visitor numbers to 7.6 million in 2014, making it the world's 13th most visited theme park, and one of the largest theme parks in Asia. Half of all visitors now come from mainland China, in growth that parallels rising mainland tourist visitor levels to Hong Kong over the same period.\n\nCovering an area of 91.5 hectares (226 acres), the park is separated by a large mountain into two areas, The Summit (Headland) and The Waterfront (Lowland). These areas can be reached by a 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) cable car system, or the Ocean Express funicular railway. To ascend the Headland, which comprises several hills, visitors can use Hong Kong's second longest outdoor escalator. The theme park has various attractions and rides, including four roller coasters, and also animal exhibits with different themes, such as a giant panda habitat, rainforest and polar displays, as well as an aquarium featuring the world's largest aquarium dome. Between 1979 and 1997, Ocean Park was most famous for its signature killer whale, Miss Hoi Wai/Susie Wong.\n\nAs well as being an amusement park, Ocean Park Hong Kong aims to merge entertainment and education, including conservation advocacy. However, it has been criticised by wildlife advocates for practices including the wild capture of large sea animals, such as dolphins and orca, and the presentation of shows featuring such animals performing.\n\nOcean Park is also renowned for holding the largest Halloween events in Asia.",

Located on the beautiful island of Lantau, the park is easily accessible and is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Hong Kong. Having recently visited the park, I can say with confidence that Disneyland Hong Kong is truly a world-class destination that exceeded all my expectations.\nUpon entering the park, I was immediately transported to a world of fairytale and fantasy. The iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle greeted me, and I couldn't help but feel like a child again. The attention to detail in every aspect of the park's design is impeccable, making it feel like I had stepped into a Disney movie.\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the various themed lands within the park. From the futuristic Tomorrowland to the wild and adventurous Adventureland, each land had its own unique charm and attractions. The rides were a perfect mix of thrilling and family-friendly, catering to all age groups. The \"It's a Small World\" ride was a personal favorite, with its catchy tune and adorable animatronic dolls representing different countries from around the world.\nWhat sets Disneyland Hong Kong apart from other theme parks is its incorporation of Chinese culture and traditions. The park celebrates Chinese festivals such as Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival, which adds a local touch to the overall Disney experience. I was also impressed by the diversity of food options available, from classic Disney snacks to authentic Chinese cuisine.\nThe entertainment at Disneyland Hong Kong is top-notch, with shows and parades happening throughout the day. The \"Festival of the Lion King\" musical was a standout, bringing the beloved characters from \"The Lion King\" to life through stunning performances and elaborate costumes.\nI was also impressed by the impeccable service provided by the staff at the park. Everyone was friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to ensure a magical experience for guests. The cleanliness and maintenance of the park were also top-notch, making for a comfortable and enjoyable visit.\nIn conclusion, Disneyland Hong Kong is a must-visit for anyone seeking a fun and enchanting experience. It is a perfect blend of Disney magic and Chinese culture, creating a unique and unforgettable destination. It truly lives up to its reputation as the happiest place on earth, and I cannot wait to visit again.",

Comprising five distinct buildings steeped in history, this sacred site offers visitors a captivating glimpse into the city’s past.\n\nAs I wandered through the complex, I was struck by the serenity of the surroundings. The intricate architecture and ornate detailing of each building spoke volumes about the craftsmanship and devotion of generations past.\n\nThe journey begins with the Kwun Yum temple, a marvel of construction dating back to 1894. Its ancient walls seem to whisper tales of centuries gone by, inviting visitors to step back in time and immerse themselves in the spiritual energy that permeates the air.\n\nNext, the Shing Wong Temple captivated my senses with its aura of reverence. Built in 1878, this sacred space exudes a sense of ancient wisdom, serving as a sanctuary for worshippers seeking solace and guidance.\n\nAt the heart of the complex lies the Tin Hau Temple, the oldest of its kind. Steeped in legend and tradition, this revered shrine pays homage to the goddess of the sea, offering a place of solace for fishermen and seafarers throughout the ages.\n\nAs I continued my exploration, I discovered the Kwun Yam Lau She Tan and Hsu Yuen, each with its own unique story to tell. From the communal hall steeped in history to the disused study hall echoing with the whispers of scholars past, every corner of the complex holds a treasure trove of memories waiting to be uncovered.\n\nAs I stood before the Nine-Dragon Wall in the Public Square Street Children’s Playground and Rest Garden, I couldn’t help but marvel at the resilience of Hong Kong’s cultural heritage. Despite the passage of time and the winds of change, the Tin Hau Temple Complex remains a steadfast symbol of tradition and spirituality.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to the Tin Hau Temple Complex was nothing short of enchanting. It’s a place where the past meets the present, and where the spirit of Hong Kong’s ancestors lives on in every stone and every prayer. Whether you’re a history buff, a spiritual seeker, or simply a curious traveler, this sacred site is a must-visit destination that will leave you in awe of the enduring power of tradition.",

The initial operation period is three years. The goal is to create an atmosphere of Hong Kong comics, promote Hong Kong comics to Hong Kong and overseas, and expand the scale of the Hong Kong comics market. However, domestic and Piracy is rampant overseas, the comics market is shrinking, and the living space for cartoonists is getting smaller and smaller. At the end of the day, my favorite painters are of course Huang Yulang, Ma Rongcheng, Shangguan Xiaobao, Shangguan Xiaoqiang, Wang Ze, Qiu Fulong, Niu Lao, Situ Cambridge, Feng Zhiming, Deng Zhihui, Fei Liang, etc.",
