I was told I couldn’t be there and had to walk a half a mile to the Googleplex. I asked if they could give me a ride. No.\n\nBefore I left, after I called them names for being so rude to me, I walked to the Googleplex store, I looked at some products and then a man came up to me and asked me to leave because I caused a disturbance.

I then walked back to my car through the same way I just came and 3 security guards approached me, told me I was trespassing and that they would call the police. They then walked right next to me the whole time intimidating me while I then started screaming obscenities at them because Google is a bunch of holier-than-though, velvet rope scumbags.\n\nYou can see my encounter online on my social media websites.
