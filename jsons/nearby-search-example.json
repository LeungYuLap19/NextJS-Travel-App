Luckily, they have a bar at front of house and we were able to get cocktails while we waited.

While parking in the area can be pricey ($8/hour!), a quick 7-8 minute walk northeast leads to free street parking and gives you a chance to explore the neighborhood.\n\nThe food was fantastic! I started with the Hog Island oysters, which were incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, without a hint of fishiness. Next, I tried the garlic grilled oysters, cooked to perfection - juicy, creamy, and infused with garlicky goodness. The old bay fries were another highlight - crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with a hint of sweetness. Even the ketchup impressed me - tangy and refreshing, it complemented the fries perfectly.\n\nThe clam chowder wasn't your typical version. Instead of small bits, it showcased plump whole clams in a slightly thinner, yet still creamy broth that avoided being overly milky.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. Plus, considering the high quality of the food, the prices were very reasonable. This hidden gem, even amidst the tourist crowds, offers excellent value and deserves a visit!",

The chowder here differs from other popular chowder places which I like, not thick. Loved the mussels with a hint of mustard. The cod was great too, plated so beautifully and tasted wonderfully. Great service as well.",

The clam chowder had a lighter soup to it while the mussels had a thicker stronger taste. Both were wiped out with the bread. The oysters were super fresh. Perfect. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again. There will be a line to queue in. But it was worth it as we were then seated at the table facing Bay Bridge and not facing the queue. It was such a good lunch. In total we spent about usd100 each. There were two of us. If you had more people the cost would be lower.",

              "text": "My girlfriend and I go to a new restaurant every week in SF, and we decided to stop by STK after seeing an ad on Instagram.\n\nAfter reading reviews here about the bad service staff, I wanted to also see if there was any merit to it. Short answer is yes, but because it’s been repeatedly stated in the reviews, it’s not really an employee problem, but a management problem.\n\nWhen we arrived for lunch, the host (shaved or bald head) didn’t even look us in the eye and seemed a little annoyed we asked for outside seating. He didn’t even seat us at the table — handing us the menus at the door and told us to sit wherever.\n\nThe server was initially okay, but when our food came, we had no silverware or napkins, so I just got up and went to the other table to get a couple of sets — as there was no one around to ask.\n\nThe $9.99 burger and fries is an amazing deal though. The food was probably 4.5. I’d definitely come back for the burger. I’d like to try the $69.99 a person steak meal another time as well.\n\nI tipped more (25%) even though our server only checked on us once, because I know the food was promotional and normally costs more. I can’t say she deserved it though— having been a bartender, my tipping scale goes from 15% (bad) to 25% (good) 😂.\n\nMy girlfriend asked for the burger to be well-done with no pink, and it was pink throughout. She told this to the server when we were paying the bill and she didn’t even apologize, just shrugged. 😂🤦🏻\u200d♂️\n\nHere’s the reason I’m leaving a review. As we walked out — going through the restaurant — we saw the server and four other employees talking, and made eye contact and said thanks and she ignored us and looked away, and I looked at everyone else and they all looked away. 🤦🏻\u200d♂️\n\nI saw a previous review that said the staff at Denny’s at 3am is better than this one and I can’t disagree. But once again, that’s on the management for their hiring and training practices. I was thinking, how can they read these reviews and not make changes? As the old saying goes, fool me once… shame on you, fool me twice… shame on me. 😉",

              "text": "My girlfriend and I go to a new restaurant every week in SF, and we decided to stop by STK after seeing an ad on Instagram.\n\nAfter reading reviews here about the bad service staff, I wanted to also see if there was any merit to it. Short answer is yes, but because it’s been repeatedly stated in the reviews, it’s not really an employee problem, but a management problem.\n\nWhen we arrived for lunch, the host (shaved or bald head) didn’t even look us in the eye and seemed a little annoyed we asked for outside seating. He didn’t even seat us at the table — handing us the menus at the door and told us to sit wherever.\n\nThe server was initially okay, but when our food came, we had no silverware or napkins, so I just got up and went to the other table to get a couple of sets — as there was no one around to ask.\n\nThe $9.99 burger and fries is an amazing deal though. The food was probably 4.5. I’d definitely come back for the burger. I’d like to try the $69.99 a person steak meal another time as well.\n\nI tipped more (25%) even though our server only checked on us once, because I know the food was promotional and normally costs more. I can’t say she deserved it though— having been a bartender, my tipping scale goes from 15% (bad) to 25% (good) 😂.\n\nMy girlfriend asked for the burger to be well-done with no pink, and it was pink throughout. She told this to the server when we were paying the bill and she didn’t even apologize, just shrugged. 😂🤦🏻\u200d♂️\n\nHere’s the reason I’m leaving a review. As we walked out — going through the restaurant — we saw the server and four other employees talking, and made eye contact and said thanks and she ignored us and looked away, and I looked at everyone else and they all looked away. 🤦🏻\u200d♂️\n\nI saw a previous review that said the staff at Denny’s at 3am is better than this one and I can’t disagree. But once again, that’s on the management for their hiring and training practices. I was thinking, how can they read these reviews and not make changes? As the old saying goes, fool me once… shame on you, fool me twice… shame on me. 😉",

Greeted at the door by two lovely ladies. Check out the cute coat closet, adorbs! The seating was very cozy, generous with pillows. Servers were phenomenal, we had Andreas, he was simply amazing. Very attentive and wonderful with the recommendations. We tried a little of everything. Hands down favorite was the charcuterie board and the risotto. Our table was not a fan of the spritzers but they have a full bar so definitely order your favorite drink. Beautiful gender neutral bathrooms. Will visit again for their lunch menu!",
